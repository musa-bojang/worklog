## 📆 **Monthly Work Log – July 2025**

### ✅ **1. Summary of What I Worked On**

This month, I focused on strengthening my frontend development skills. I completed **Week 1 to Week 3 modules** covering **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, while also beginning my journey into **Next.js**. I explored various learning platforms, especially **W3Schools**, and began incorporating **wireframing** into my project planning process. I also took the time to learn and apply **Git** and **GitHub** for version control.

---

### 🏆 **2. Achievements**

* ✅ Completed 3 weeks of structured frontend modules
* ✅ Gained practical experience using Git and GitHub
* ✅ Started using wireframes to better structure UI designs
* ✅ Built small projects to reinforce JavaScript concepts
* ✅ Took the first steps into learning Next.js (a big leap!)

---

### 💡 **3. Learnings from Failures or Challenges**

* 😅 Some JavaScript concepts, especially the more complex ones, remain a challenge.
* 🧠 I realized that passive learning (reading/watching tutorials) alone isn’t enough — applying the knowledge in **real-world mini-projects** is what cements it.
* 🔁 I’ve learned that consistent practice and **debugging on my own** are helping me understand the logic better.
* 🛠️ Plan: Break down difficult topics into smaller parts and **build more mini-apps** using those concepts.

### ✨ **4. Monthly Highlights**

* 🚀 Starting my journey into **Next.js**
* 🧰 Using Git and GitHub confidently for tracking changes and storing code
* 🧱 Learning how to wireframe before coding – this made my project execution more organized
* 🧠 Feeling more confident in writing JavaScript logic from scratch

---

### 🎯 **Looking Ahead (August Goals)**

* Build a complete **JavaScript application** (e.g., to-do list, calculator, or car search app)
* Deepen understanding of **Next.js routing, API routes, and file structure**
* Start using **Shadcn UI or Tailwind** in small Next.js projects
* Continue practicing JavaScript by solving problems on **LeetCode or Codewars**
