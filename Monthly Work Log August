**Monthly Work Log – August 2025**

**1. Summary of What I Worked On**
This month, I focused on improving my front-end development skills, particularly in **HTML** and **CSS**, while also making progress in **JavaScript**. My practice included building small layouts, styling elements, and experimenting with responsive designs.

**2. Achievements**

* Learned several new HTML tags and attributes to improve structure and semantics.
* Explored different CSS selectors and properties to style content more effectively.
* Made progress in JavaScript fundamentals and integrated small scripts into my practice projects.

**3. Learnings from Failures or Challenges**

* CSS still poses challenges, especially in positioning and layout responsiveness.
* Balancing practice with my work schedule has been difficult, leading to less consistent coding sessions.
* Some styling tasks took longer than expected, showing I need more repetition to build speed and confidence.

**4. Next Steps / Focus Areas**

* Dedicate short but consistent practice sessions to reinforce CSS concepts, especially Flexbox and Grid.
* Continue integrating JavaScript into projects to solidify both styling and interactivity skills.
* Work on a small project that combines HTML, CSS, and JS to apply what I’ve learned in a real-world context.
